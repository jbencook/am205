AM205: Incremental SVD
======================

## Data cleaning and generation

The entire ratings matrix is being hosted in a sparse and compressed format on my Bluehost server. It can be downloaded with the following command:

    wget http://jbenjamincook.com/jbc/ratings_matrix.mtx.gz

This can be decompressed with the following:

    unpigz ratings_matrix.mtx.gz

Or if pigz is not installed on your system, you can use:

    gunzip ratings_matrix.mtx.gz

## Utils training and test set

Note: This is not required as we provided a training and test set for your use.

To get a subset of the dataset, we run:

    python utils/subset-data.py <path to ratings_matrix.mtx> <m> <n>

e.g.

    python utils/subset-data.py ~/ratings_matrix.mtx 3000 1000

To split it into a training and test set, you can use:

    python utils/train_test_split.py

## Reconstruction error for SVD versus incremental SVD

    python svd_reconstruct.py

## RMSE on testing data set and deviations from orthogonality

    python incremental_svd.py
